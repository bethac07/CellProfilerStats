{"name":"Cellprofilerstats","tagline":"Programs for turning Cell Profiler data into graphs and meaningful statistics","body":"This program takes .csv files output from Cell Profiler and allows you to add measurements between features, normalize intensities of children objects by those of their parent objects, calculate ratios between numbers of objects or between different wavelengths, and much more.\r\n\r\nIt also allows you to perform statistical analysis between different datasets (ie different treatmeants, genotypes, different versions of the same protocol for optimization , and graphs the output while it's at it. Right now this is set for two non-parametric statistical tests (Mann-Whitney and KS, both corrected by Holm-Bonferroni), with swarm plots and cumulative frequency plots of all data analyzed returned as vector graphs in a PDF. Optimization for 96- and 384- well plates is in progress.\r\n\r\nIt is moderately customizable when run from the GUI, and the ability to create defaults allows you to pick the parameters you care about and look at them over and over again very quickly; great for optimization of your protocol or of your Cell Profiler analysis.\r\n\r\nWorking on building nice packaged distributions; in the meantime it requires python 2.7 with xlrd, xlwt, xlutils, easygui, matplotlib, statsmodels, PIL, and scipy.\r\n\r\nTry it, let me know how it works for you, just please acknowledge it if it helps your science!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
